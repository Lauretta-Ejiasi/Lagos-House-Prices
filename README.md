# Lagos-House-Prices
This project showcases my ability to perform exploratory data analysis on House Prices in Lagos Nigeria. 

Insight from this analysis will be used to make informed descisions on:
- House pricing,
- Best fit locations according to household income,
- Locations with the most expensinve houses
- And how house prices can affect population density amongst other insights.
